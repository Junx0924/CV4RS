This project is a cleaned up version of our PAMI submission 
"Deep Metric Learning with BIER: Boosting Independent Embeddings Robustly" in tensorflow. It extends our
original ICCV version with an adversarial auxiliary loss during training, which improves results.

To run the code, see ./run.sh and ./run_eval.sh.
The train-images file is a numpy file consisting of images of size 256x256 and train-labels are the corresponding
labels. The label indices should be between [0, total-number-of-labels) (i.e. they should be non-negative, and continuous).

The initial weights for the GoogLeNet InceptionV1 model (dumped from the caffe model) is available at: https://files.icg.tugraz.at/d/c3e1a047fc/
